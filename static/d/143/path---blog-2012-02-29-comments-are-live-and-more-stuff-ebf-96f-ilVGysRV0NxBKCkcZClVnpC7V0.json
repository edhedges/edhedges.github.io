{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I have updated my blog to allow for anonymous comments using the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/\">django comments framework</a>!</p>\n<p>I chose to go anonymous because as it says in the <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/\">Zen of Python</a> that <code>Simple is better than complex.</code></p>\n<p>The jQuery hack hasn't been implemented yet but will be soon. The only problem I have is that since I am using the django comments my sites navigation styles I am using don't apply when there is an error with the comment form. Other than that I am satisfied with the simple comments that are now live with my blog.</p>\n<p>The next update for comments will be to allow for <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">markdown</a> because its awesome!</p>\n<p>As I mentioned in a <a href=\"http://edhedges.com/blog/archives/next-items-my-agenda/\">previous post</a> I wanted to implement markdown syntax to create blog posts and I did!</p>\n<p>My custom admin form for my blog is just a simple form that reads markdown and converts it to look great once posted but it isn't the best for actually writing the post. That is why I have been using <a href=\"http://dillinger.io/\">Dillinger</a>. The real time markdown and html5 editing is amazing with a great looking interface. In my opinion there isn't a better free online editor.</p>\n<p>List view of next items on my agenda:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make that quick jquery/style change to keep uniformity (because uniformity rocks)</li>\n<li>Adding markdown to the blog comments</li>\n<li>Hopefully pick up some freelance projects along the way</li>\n<li>Implement the ability to add media to my blog app</li>\n<li>In march I will be overhauling my <a href=\"https://github.com/edhedges/eds-djangoplate\">django boilerplate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That wraps it up for me thanks for reading!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 29, 2012","path":"/blog/2012/02/29/comments-are-live-and-more-stuff","title":"Comments are live and more stuff","tags":["Python","Django","jQuery","Dillinger","Markdown"]}}},"pageContext":{}}

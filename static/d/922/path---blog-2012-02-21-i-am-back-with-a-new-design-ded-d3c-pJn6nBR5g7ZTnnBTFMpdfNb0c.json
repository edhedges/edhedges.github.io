{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Well I have been hard at work in the design department because I wanted\nmy site to be responsive and look good on any browser size. I have also\nbeen working on my custom blog admin and the thing I am most proud of is\nthat I have built a wonderful django boilerplate.</p>\n<p>My boilerplate is on github and can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/edhedges/eds-djangoplate\">here</a>. I built the\nboilerplate because I wanted a standard setup for all my future\nprojects. The boilerplate will not only help me speed up my development\nbut will make integrating outside code simple as well as making\ndeployment a simple task thanks to <a href=\"http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.0/index.html\">fabric</a>.</p>\n<p>Below I will show you a fab function that runs when I deploy to\nproduction.</p>\n<p>{% highlight py %}\ndef deploy():\n\"\"\"\nDeploys the django project.\n\"\"\"\nrun('mkproject %s' % PROJECT<em>ID)\nwith cd(env.current</em>project<em>dir):\nrun('git init')\nrun('git pull <a href=\"https://edhedges@bitbucket.org/edhedges/%25s.git\">https://edhedges@bitbucket.org/edhedges/%s.git</a> master' % PROJECT</em>ID)\nrun('pip-2.7 install -r conf/requirements.txt')\nrun('python2.7 manage.py new<em>secret')\nrun('python2.7 manage.py syncdb')\nrun('python2.7 manage.py migrate')\nrun('mv static/* %s' % env.static</em>dir)\nwith cd(env.static<em>dir):\nrun('rm -rf admin')\nreplace</em>httpdconf()\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>This command I can run by typing ‘fab deploy’ makes a project directory\nand a virtual environment, then it initializes a git repo in the project\nfolder and pulls my project in. After that is done it install all\ndependencies using pip and it moves the static folder into my static\nurl. After all that is done it replaces the default httpd.conf file with\none tailored to my project and restarts apache.</p>\n<p>Sta tuned for more django/python awesome!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 21, 2012","path":"/blog/2012/02/21/i-am-back-with-a-new-design","title":"Back with a new design","tags":["Python","Django","Fabric"]}}},"pageContext":{}}

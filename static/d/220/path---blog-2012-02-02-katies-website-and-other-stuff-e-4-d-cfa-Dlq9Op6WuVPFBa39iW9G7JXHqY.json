I am proud of her because to be honest she isn’t that tech savvy.</p>\n<h4>Now on to some news about what I will be working on next.</h4>\n<p>I plan on making my blogging application great and here is a list of\nsome of the things I want to add to it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A custom admin because I am using the django admin at the moment and\neven though its awesome if I want to distribute this app and have\nothers use it their should be a custom admin.</li>\n<li>An ability to leave comments on a post. I haven’t decided whether to\nmake them anonymous or have users sign up for a simple account yet.</li>\n<li>The ability to upload pictures to make it look more appealing.</li>\n<li>I currently make my posts by writing html that goes into my page\nfrom the admin but I want to start using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">markdown</a>. I am really\nexcited for this part because I found an awesome online editor\ncalled <a href=\"http://dillinger.io/\">Dillinger</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly I know there are tons of blogging apps out there in many\nlanguages but I am building this app because I want it to be the\nsimplest (for users) as well as learn many things along the way.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 02, 2012","path":"/blog/2012/02/02/katies-website-and-other-stuff","title":"Katie's website and other stuff","tags":["Katie-Phillips","iWeb","Dillinger","Markdown"]}}},"pageContext":{}}

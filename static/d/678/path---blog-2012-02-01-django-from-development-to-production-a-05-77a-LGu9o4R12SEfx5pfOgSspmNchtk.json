{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In this blog I will briefly describe my process of taking my local development work and putting it into production which is what I did with this site and its features.</p>\n<p>For my development process I am using the simple local server that django/python provides you by running:</p>\n<p>{% highlight pycon %}\npython manage.py runserver\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>If you are a more experienced dev then there are things such as <a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv\">virtualenv</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.3.4/index.html\">fabric</a> but I kept it simple for this first large project.</p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://www.webfaction.com/\">webfaction</a> as my hosting service and love them. The admin side allows for easy installation of django and MySQL database creation from the browser! If you are looking into doing development I would definitely check out webfaction.</p>\n<p>Now getting back on track below will be a list of things that will be different for production in the settings.py file from your local project.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set DEBUG and TEMPLATE_DEBUG = False</li>\n<li>Make sure to change your DATABASES if you plan on not using sqlite3</li>\n<li>Lastly make sure your static, media, and template settings are changed to match your production file layout.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the first two are pretty self explanatory and well documented in the django docs but the third gave me a bit of a headache. During development django will get static files from within your project but when DEBUG = False (<a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-DEBUG\">which it should be when its in production</a>) django will not serve those static files. In webfaction I have made a static application which lives at a specific URL and that will serve all my css, js, and other static files.\nFor a more in depth look at deploying django check out the <a href=\"http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter12/\">django book chapter 12</a>. It is a bit old but got me through.</p>\n<p>That sums it up thanks for reading!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 01, 2012","path":"/blog/2012/02/01/django-from-development-to-production","title":"Django from development to production","tags":["Python","Django","Development","Production"]}}},"pageContext":{}}

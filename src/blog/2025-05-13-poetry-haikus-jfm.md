It's been a little over four years since I last wrote a post, but recently I felt like challenging myself a bit artistically and have decided a good starting point would be to try my hand at some poetry, starting with the haiku.

With that in mind, this will be the first in a series of four posts that will contain a three haikus, each pertaining to a specific month. I'm publishing this one a little later than I wanted to, but this one will cover January, February, and March.

## January
Cold, dark, yet brand new

Abrupt, empty, uncertain

Opportunity

## February
Short, sweet, and unique

Kisses, hugs, love from the heart

Don’t blink or it’s past

## March
Thawing before spring

Origin of growing life

Blooming with delight

I've enjoyed stepping away from the hustle and bustle of my day job and diving into what each of the aforementioned months mean to me, working within the constraints of a haiku, and letting myself be a little creative.

I'm back (better late than never, eh) with the second installment of my haiku series! This time, I'll be focusing on the months of April, May, and June. Part 1 can be read [here](/blog/2025/05/13/poetry-haikus-jfm).

### April
Showers and flowers

Tulips galore, bright, carefree

Puddles for splashing

### May
Green grass, warm sun, bask

Berry picking and hiking

Anniversary


### June
Summertime is nigh

Pools, lakes, and the sea beckon

Water gives us life

This and the next 3 months tend to be my favorites. I think it's the combination of many of my family's life events having their anniversary within them and nature is begging us to be outside, my favorite place to be. Modern life has enabled us to have some semblance of control or at least mitigation of natures extremes, but the sun, the sea, and the plants are wonderful and life giving!
